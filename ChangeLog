    * ETResponse.java: Don't constrain T to subtypes of ETObject
    (so we can return integers as the result of create requests).
    * soap/ETResponseImpl.java: Likewise.

2014-04-13  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@exacttarget.com>

    * model/converter/ObjectConverter.java: Moved into new directory for
    deprecated sources (src/main-deprecated/java/com/exacttarget/fuelsdk).

2014-03-29  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@exacttarget.com>

    * ETClient.java: Added new constructor that takes properties file.

2014-03-28  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@exacttarget.com>

    * Released version 0.999999.

2014-03-23  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@exacttarget.com>

    * ETSoapObject.java (getInternalProperty): New function.
    (getInternalProperties): Renamed from getProperties() and made static.
    (getField): Made private.
    (getAllFields): Made private.
    * soap/ETGetServiceImpl.java (get): Use new getInternalProperty()
    and getInternalProperties() methods.

    * Added support for partial object loading. Now, if you want to include
    only specific properties of the object(s) in the response, you can do
    that by specifying the property names as arguments to the get call, e.g.:

        ETResponse<ETList> response = service.get(client, "name",
                                                  "description");

    You can also use partial object loading when using filters:

        ETResponse<ETList> response = service.get(client, filter, "name",
                                                  "description");

    As before, if no properties are specified, all properties are
    loaded, e.g.:

        ETResponse<ETList> response = service.get(client);

    or

        ETResponse<ETList> response = service.get(client);

    * ETClient.java (refreshToken): Return the new access token.
    Update the SOAP header with the new legacy token.

    * ETRestConnection.java: Keep track of whether the connection is
    an auth connection (to avoid infinite loops).
    (sendRequest): Refresh the access token if necessary but only if
    this isn't an auth connection.

    * ETSoapConnection.java (updateHeaders): New method.

2014-03-20  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@exacttarget.com>

    * ETSoapObject.java: Removed legacy ClientID property.

    * model/ETClientID.java: Deleted.

    * soap/ETGetServiceImpl.java (get): Automatically refresh the
    OAuth token if necessary.
    * soap/ETCrudServiceImpl.java (post, patch, delete): Likewise.

2014-03-14  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@exacttarget.com>

    * ETSoapObject.java: Fixed bug related to object conversion of
    data extension rows.

    * model/ETDataExtensionColumn.java: Add "ID" to ignoredFields. The
    presence of this field was causing retrieves to return an error.

    * model/converter/ObjectConverter.java:
    Added (deprecated) ObjectConverter class that wraps toInternal()
    and fromInternal() ETSoapObject methods for backward compatibility
    with old convertFromEtObject() and convertToEtObject() methods.
