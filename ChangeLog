    * src/main/java/com/exacttarget/fuelsdk/ETClient.java: Added new constructor
    that takes properties file.

2014-03-28  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@exacttarget.com>

    * Released version 0.999999.

2014-03-23  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@exacttarget.com>

    * src/main/java/com/exacttarget/fuelsdk/ETSoapObject.java
    (getInternalProperty): New function.
    (getInternalProperties): Renamed from getProperties() and made static.
    (getField): Made private.
    (getAllFields): Made private.
    * src/main/java/com/exacttarget/fuelsdk/soap/ETGetServiceImpl.java (get): Use
    new getInternalProperty() and getInternalProperties() methods in ETSoapObject.

    * Added support for partial object loading. Now, if you want to include
    only specific properties of the object(s) in the response, you can do
    that by specifying the property names as arguments to the get call, e.g.:

        ETResponse<ETList> response = service.get(client, "name", "description");

    You can also use partial object loading when using filters:

        ETResponse<ETList> response = service.get(client, filter, "name", "description");

    As before, if no properties are specified, all properties are loaded, e.g.:

        ETResponse<ETList> response = service.get(client);

    or

        ETResponse<ETList> response = service.get(client);

    * src/main/java/com/exacttarget/fuelsdk/ETClient.java (refreshToken): Return
    the new access token. Update the SOAP header with the new legacy token.
    * src/main/java/com/exacttarget/fuelsdk/ETRestConnection.java: Keep track
    of whether the connection is an auth connection (to avoid infinite loops).
    (sendRequest): Refresh the access token if necessary, but only if this isn't
    an auth connection.
    * src/main/java/com/exacttarget/fuelsdk/ETSoapConnection.java (updateHeaders):
    New method.

2014-03-20  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@exacttarget.com>

    * src/main/java/com/exacttarget/fuelsdk/soap/ETGetServiceImpl.java
    (get): Automatically refresh the OAuth token if necessary.
    * src/main/java/com/exacttarget/fuelsdk/soap/ETCrudServiceImpl.java
    (post, patch, delete): Likewise.

    * src/main/java/com/exacttarget/fuelsdk/ETSoapObject.java: Removed
    legacy ClientID property.
    * src/main/java/com/exacttarget/fuelsdk/model/ETClientID.java: Deleted.

    * src/main/java/com/exacttarget/fuelsdk/ETSoapObject.java: Fixed
    bug related to object conversion of data extension rows.

    * src/main/java/com/exacttarget/fuelsdk/model/ETDataExtensionColumn.java:
    Add "ID" to ignoredFields. The presence of this field was causing
    retrieves to return an error.

    * src/main/java/com/exacttarget/fuelsdk/model/converter/ObjectConverter.java:
    Added (deprecated) ObjectConverter class that wraps toInternal()
    and fromInternal() ETSoapObject methods for backward compatibility
    with old convertFromEtObject() and convertToEtObject() methods.
