Version 0.999999
----------------

The primary new feature is the addition of partial object loading.
Now, if you want to include only specific properties of the object(s)
in the response, you can do that by specifying the property names
as arguments to the get call, e.g.:

    ETResponse<ETList> response = service.get(client, "name", "description");

You can also use partial object loading when using filters:

    ETResponse<ETList> response = service.get(client, filter, "name", "description");

As before, if no properties are specified, all properties are loaded, e.g.:

    ETResponse<ETList> response = service.get(client);

or

    ETResponse<ETList> response = service.get(client);

There were also numerous bug fixes and smaller feature enhancements.
For more information, please see the ChangeLog file.
